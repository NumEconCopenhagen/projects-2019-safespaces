# Examproject

In the examproject we solve the questions in chronological order.

**If you do not have numpy version 1.15.4, you might run into problems using the scipy.optimize module.

You might also encounter problems interacting with the 3D plots in 3.2. 
If you do, try running the cells a couple of times, this solves the problem.

To produce the results in the examproject - run all cells and enjoy.
