# General README.md for the portofolio

The portfolio consists of 3 projects:
 - a dataproject where we explore the expenditures in the public sector
 - a modelproject where we solve and analyse a solowmodel with human capital, and afterwards with a CES production function
 - an examproject where we solve the exam questions.
 
 There are a few specific requirements for some of the projects which are described in the project-specific README.md files.
